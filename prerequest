# Lab Instructions: MySQL database project 

## Scenario 

Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant, focused on traditional recipes served with a modern twist. The chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek, and Turkish culture and have a menu of 12â€“15 items that they rotate seasonally. The restaurant has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with moderate prices, making it a popular place for a meal any time of the day.  

Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who moved to the United States to pursue their shared dream of owning a restaurant. To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his experience as a chef in Italy. Adrian does all the marketing for the restaurant and led the effort to expand the menu beyond classic Italian to incorporate additional cuisines from the Mediterranean region.

### Prerequisites   

In order to complete this lab, you must first have created the Little Lemon database in MySQL. You must also have the Customers, Bookings and Courses tables created and populated with relevant data as shown below.   

1: The code to create the database is as follows:
```SQL  
CREATE DATABASE Little_Lemon;  
```  

2: The code to use the database is as follows:  
 

```SQL  
USE Little_Lemon;  
```  

3: The code to create the Customers table is as follows:  

```SQL  
CREATE TABLE Customers(CustomerID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, FullName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,    PhoneNumber INT NOT NULL UNIQUE);  
```  

4: The code to create the Customers table is as follows

```SQL  
INSERT INTO Customers(CustomerID, FullName, PhoneNumber) VALUES 
    (1, "Vanessa McCarthy", 0757536378), 
    (2, "Marcos Romero", 0757536379), 
    (3, "Hiroki Yamane", 0757536376), 
    (4, "Anna Iversen", 0757536375),
    (5, "Diana Pinto", 0757536374),
    (6, "Altay Ayhan", 0757636378), 
    (7, "Jane Murphy", 0753536379), 
    (8, "Laurina Delgado", 0754536376), 
    (9, "Mike Edwards", 0757236375),
    (10, "Karl Pederson", 0757936374);    
```     

The Customers table is shown in the following screenshot:

5: The code to create the Bookings table is as follows:  

```SQL   
CREATE TABLE Bookings (   
BookingID INT,   
BookingDate DATE,   
TableNumber INT,    
NumberOfGuests INT,   
CustomerID INT    
);  
```  

6: The code to populate the Bookings table with data is as follows: 

```SQL   
INSERT INTO Bookings (BookingID, BookingDate, TableNumber, NumberOfGuests, CustomerID) VALUES
(10, '2021-11-10', 7, 5, 1), 
(11, '2021-11-10', 5, 2, 2), 
(12, '2021-11-10', 3, 2, 4),
(13, '2021-11-11', 2, 5, 5), 
(14, '2021-11-11', 5, 2, 6), 
(15, '2021-11-11', 3, 2, 7),
(16, '2021-11-11', 3, 5, 1), 
(17, '2021-11-12', 5, 2, 2), 
(18, '2021-11-12', 3, 2, 4),
(19, '2021-11-13', 7, 5, 6), 
(20, '2021-11-14', 5, 2, 3), 
(21, '2021-11-14', 3, 2, 4);      
```  

The Bookings table is shown in the following screenshot:

7: The code to create the restaurant Courses table is as follows:

```SQL   
CREATE TABLE Courses (CourseName VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY, Cost Decimal(4,2)); 
```  

8: The code to populate the restaurant's Courses table with data is as follows:  

```SQL
Insert into Courses (CourseName, Cost) VALUES ("Greek salad", 15.50), ("Bean soup", 12.25), ("Pizza", 15.00), ("Carbonara", 12.50), ("Kabasa", 17.00), ("Shwarma", 11.30); 
```  

The Courses table is shown in the following screenshot:
